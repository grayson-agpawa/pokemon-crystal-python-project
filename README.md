**Goal:** <br>
The goal of this Data Analysis project was to answer the question:<br> 
"What would be the best 6 Pok√©mon to grab in Pokemon Crystal to have greater chances of winning?"

**Criteria:** <br>
- Highest Base Stats
- Non-Legendary Pokemon
- Non-Endgame Pokemon
- Good Diversity of Poke Types (so having a water type be ready for a fire type, etc.)
- Looking for at least 2 Stats that are over 100, 3 over 100 is best
- Looking for more high Attack/Sp. Atk. Defense and high HP are a plus, but they do not ultimately fit the critera. <br>
For Example: Shuckle is a 200 Defense but 10 Attack. He sucks. He would get a KO quick. Therefore I would not use him in my Top 6.
